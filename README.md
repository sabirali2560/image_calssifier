IMAGE CLASSIFIER:
      
      This image classifier classifies the images of cars, motorbikes and bicycles.This repository contains only the backend part of the 
      image classifier. Currently I am working on the frontend and will update the complete API soon. The image calssifier is a basic 
      application of computer vision. This image classifier can be used in the parking systems for recognising the images of cars, bicycles
      and motorbikes.

      The training and test sets of the images were taken from a competition hosted on kaggle.com. The scripts bicypix,bictestpix,carpix,cartestpix,
      motorpix,motortestpix are used for resizing and generating training,test data in the form of pixels.

                        * As of now since this repository contains only the backend code you can just simply paste the adress of your image
                          in the image_classifier.ipynb python script by assigning it to the variable img_path and run the script.
